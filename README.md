# NATO-Phonetic-Alphabet
Prompting user to enter a word :This project returns the NATO Phonetic Alphabets as a LIST

Description of the Application:
We in out daily lives come across situations where we have to speak over the phone and give information about 
out NAME, ADDRESS etc our to a ONLNE delivery person or Booking Consultation with Doctor , we give details.
Since we are speaking over the phone , our words may not be clearly understood by the person whom we are trying to pass on 
the information. So waht we is like for example my name "PAVANI", P as in PARIS, A as in APPLE.

This Application instead of us thinking what word to use , the word given is converted into NATO - Phonetics WORDS as list.
And makes our job easy.
